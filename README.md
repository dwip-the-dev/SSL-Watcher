> ⚠️ WARNING: This tool might make your ISP file a restraining order. Use responsibly (or don't — I'm not your mom).

🗿 WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS?

SSL Watcher Pro is what happens when you give a sleep-deprived developer too much caffeine and access to the ssl module.
This Python script:

👀 Stalks SSL certificates like they're your ex on Instagram

📧 Spams your inbox with panic-inducing emails

📊 Generates PDF reports that nobody will ever read

🔥 Burns through your Gmail quota like it's 1999

🖥️ INSTALLATION (IF YOU DARE)

# Step 1: Clone this repository (like anyone will actually contribute)
git clone https://github.com/dwip-the-dev/SSL-Watcher.git
cd SSL-Watcher

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment (because we're fancy like that)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies (pray to the Python gods)
pip install flask reportlab

# Step 4: Sacrifice a router to the networking gods
# (Seriously, don't actually run destructive commands.)


---

⚙️ CONFIGURATION (THE "FUCK IT" SETUP)

1. Edit the code like a degenerate (find the SMTP config part).


2. Put in your Gmail and app password (RIP your account security).


3. Create emails.json with all the people you want to annoy:



{
  "emails": [
    "your-boss@company.com",
    "your-ex@regret.com",
    "random-stranger@why-not.com"
  ]
}


---

🚀 USAGE (HOW TO PISS PEOPLE OFF)

# Run this bad boy
python3 main.py

# Then open http://localhost:5000 and prepare for:
# - Regret
# - Confusion
# - "Why did I build this again?"

📑 PDF REPORTS

The tool can create PDF reports summarizing certificate details and expiry info. (Most of these PDFs will be ignored, like 99% of status emails.)
