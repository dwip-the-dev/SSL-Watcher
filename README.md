## 🚨 SSL WATCHER PRO - THE SSL EXORCIST 💀🔥

## ⚠️ WARNING: This tool might make your ISP file a restraining order. Use responsibly (or don't, I'm not your mom).

---

## 🗿 WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS?

SSL Watcher Pro is what happens when you give a sleep-deprived developer too much caffeine and access to the SSL module. It's a Python script that:

· 👀 Stalks SSL certificates like they're your ex on Instagram

· 📧 Spams your inbox with panic-inducing emails

· 📊 Generates PDF reports that nobody will ever read

· 🔥 Burns through your Gmail quota like it's 1999

## 🖥️ INSTALLATION (IF YOU DARE)

```bash
# Step 1: Clone this repository (like anyone will actually contribute)
git clone https://github.com/dwip-the-dev/SSL-Watcher.git
cd SSL-Watcher

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment (because we're fancy like that)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies (pray to the Python gods)
pip install flask reportlab

# Step 4: Sacrifice a router to the networking gods
sudo rm -rf /your/sense/of/sanity
```

---

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION (THE "FUCK IT" SETUP)

1. Edit the code like a degenerate (find the SMTP config part)
2. Put in your Gmail and app password (RIP your account security)
3. Create emails.json with all the people you want to annoy:

```json
{
  "emails": [
    "your-boss@company.com",
    "your-ex@regret.com", 
    "random-stranger@why-not.com"
  ]
}
```

---

## 🚀 USAGE (HOW TO PISS PEOPLE OFF)

```bash
# Run this bad boy
python3 main.py

# Then open http://localhost:5000 and prepare for:
# - Regret
# - Confusion  
# - Why did I build this again?
```

## 🎯 FEATURES NOBODY ASKED FOR

· ✅ SSL Stalking - Watches certificates like a creepy neighbor

· ✅ Email Terrorism - Spams everyone you've ever met

· ✅ PDF Generation - Creates reports that will never be opened

· ✅ Web UI - So you can feel like a 1337 h4x0r

· ✅ Background Checks - Runs while you sleep (creepy)

· ✅ Multi-recipient Annoyance - Why bother one person when you can bother everyone?

## 📧 EMAILS YOU'LL SEND (AND REGRET)

```
🚨 SSL Alert: example.com expires in 15 days!

Translation: "Please unsubscribe me from your life choices"
```

AND WHEN AN SSL IS EXPIRING IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SEND THE ALERT - THE TEST EMAIL IS ONLY FOR TESTING AND NOT THE REAL ALERT. SO JUST WAIT AND WATCH 😐😐😐😐
